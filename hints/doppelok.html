            You are given key points to find and replace in the string. Well, it seems to be clear from the condition. You can do it with the help of a loop in which you will perform checks and replace elements, or, what is better, add changes to some kind of list or line.

            Let's define a variable with vowel letters <b class="code">letters</b>, a variable where we will store the result <b class="code">new</b>, and an additional variable <b class="code">index</b>. And we will also use a <b class="code">while</b> loop for our solution.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
letters = "aeiouy"
new = ''
index = 0

            With the help of a while loop, we will go through our text. To do this, we define the cycle condition. We will use the variable <b class="code">index</b> as the index of the text element, so in the loop we will increase it by 1 each time.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
letters = "aeiouy"
new = ''
index = 0
while index < len(text):
    ...
    index += 1
        </pre>

            Let's add the conditions for checking the element. For example, if we get a letter that is not in the list of vowels, then we need to make sure that there is one vowel after it. If we get a letter that is in the list of vowel letters - we need to make sure that there are two more the same letters after it. And also a condition for checking whether a string element is a space.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
letters = "aeiouy"
new = ''
index = 0
while index < len(text):
    if text[index] == ' ':
        ...
    elif text[index] not in letters and text[index + 1] in letters:
        ...
    elif text[index] in letters:
        if text[index:index + 3] == text[index] * 3:
            ...
    index += 1
        </pre>

            So we need to add a letter to our <b class="code">new</b> variable when the conditions are met. At the same time, it should be taken into account that if we add a non-vowel letter, then our index must shift by one more element, and if we add a vowel, then by two elements.

        <pre class="brush: python">
letters = "aeiouy"
new = ''
index = 0
while index < len(text):
    if text[index] == ' ':
        new += text[index]
    elif text[index] not in letters and text[index + 1] in letters:
        new += text[index]
        index += 1
    elif text[index] in letters:
        if text[index:index + 3] == text[index] * 3:
            new += text[index]
            index += 2
    index += 1

            All you have to do is wrap the code in a function expression and return our <b class="code">new</b> variable.

            Okay, okay! That's the spirit!=) This decision will be difficult to understand. Modules are used here: <a target="_blank" href='https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/re.html'>re</a> and <a target="_blank" href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html'>functools</a>. Since under the condition of the mission, we can be sure that the correct phrase is transmitted, then using logic: every letter that is repeated three times must be repeated once, every letter that is not repeated, and there is another letter after it, must be without this one some letter

translate = functools.partial(re.sub,r"(\w)(\1\1|.)",r"\1")
